# Agentic AI & Business Process Automation Workshop

*Hands-on workshop delivered to 60+ students teaching design and implementation of AI-powered business workflows*

Delivered at **University of Nevada, Reno** | October 2025

## Overview

This 3-day workshop moved from theory to implementation, with participants building two core automation patterns:

1. **AI-Powered Customer Insights Extraction**  
   Using ChatGPT to analyze unstructured review data and extract actionable product feedback through iterative prompt refinement

2. **Intelligent Sentiment Routing System**  
   Using Zapier to orchestrate multi-step workflows that capture reviews, perform AI sentiment analysis, route negative feedback to Slack, and maintain performance metrics

By Day 3, students with no prior automation experience were confidently building and presenting their own AI-powered workflows grounded in practical business applications.
