# Demo 1: AI-Powered Customer Insights Extraction

## Overview
Demonstration of how iterative prompt engineering can extract actionable insights from unstructured customer review data using ChatGPT.

## Use Case
Analyzing product reviews (AirPods Pro 3) to identify common complaints and generate stakeholder-ready summaries.

## What's Included
- **`sample-review-digest.md`** - Example review data used in the demo
- **`prompt-iterations.md`** - Three progressive prompt refinements showing evolution from basic query to polished output

## Key Learning
The same data can produce dramatically different outputs based on prompt structure. By adding role context, output constraints, and audience awareness, we transformed verbose responses into decision-ready insights.

## Try It Yourself
1. Review the sample data in `sample-review-digest.md`
2. Follow the prompt progression in `prompt-iterations.md`
3. Test with your own review data from any product/service
